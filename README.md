# ChaseYourCrush

This app is a simple story game.
The story is determined by the user's choice, so you can play the game for various endings. I wish you chase a girlfriend or boyfriend successfully!
I utilized MVC design patterns to efficiently distribute code, constructed story brains using structure, and used multiple arrays.
